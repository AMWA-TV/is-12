# AMWA IS-12 NMOS Device Control Protocol \[Work In Progress\]

This document aims to give a general description of the NMOS Device Control protocol. This protocol is compatible and adheres to the rules and requirements described in the NMOS Modeling architecture document and and is the way in which NMOS Control models (described in the NMOS Control Framework) can be exposed and consumed in a standardized way.

This document relies on previous familiarity with the following existing documents:

- [AMWA MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
- [AMWA MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02)

A set of workflow examples are described in the [Examples](Creating%20a%20session.md) section.
