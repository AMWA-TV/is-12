# NMOS Control Protocol (NC-Protocol)

This document aims to give a general description of the NMOS Device Control protocol. This protocol is compatible and adheres to the rules and requirements described in the NMOS Modeling architecture document and is the way in which NMOS Control models can be exposed and consumed in a standardized way.

This document relies on previous familiarity with the following existing documents:

* NC-Architecture (NMOS Control Architecture)
* NC-Framework (NMOS Control Framework)

A set of workflow examples are described in the [Examples](Creating%20a%20session.md) section.
